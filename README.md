# Neuromodulation

This directory contains code to analyze widefield cortical imaging data. Types of analysis include estimation of convolution kernels, regression, and functional connectivity analysis. Published datasets can be found at https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/001211. The supporting function f_extractNWB.m can be used to load and extract variables from .nwb files.
